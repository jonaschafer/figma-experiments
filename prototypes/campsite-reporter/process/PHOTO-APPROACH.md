[Continues to next question]
```

### When Vehicle Selected
```
[After all vehicle questions...]
Bot: "Great! Please take photos of the vehicle 
      and have them ready to attach to the email."
[Continues to next question]
```

### At Summary/Submit
```
Bot: "📸 IMPORTANT: Don't forget to attach your 
      photos to the email before sending!"

[Email opens with body text:]
NOTE: Photos will be attached to this email.
```

## 🎯 Why This Is Better

### Simpler Code
- No complex FileReader logic
- No photo preview rendering
- No file input handling
- ~200 lines of code removed

### Clearer UX
- No confusing "upload then can't auto-attach" flow
- Direct instruction: "take photos, attach to email"
- Users understand what they need to do
- Matches how they'd naturally do it anyway

### More Reliable
- No browser compatibility issues with FileReader
- No file size limits
- No memory issues from storing base64 images
- Works identically on all devices

### Honest About Limitations
- We can't auto-attach photos via mailto links
- Rather than pretend we can (upload → "oops can't attach")
- Just tell users upfront: "take photos, attach them manually"
- This is what they'd have to do anyway!

## 💡 User Mental Model

**What users understand:**
1. Answer questions about campsite ✅
2. Be reminded to take photos ✅
3. Email opens with report ✅
4. Attach photos to email ✅
5. Send ✅

**What was confusing before:**
1. Answer questions ✅
2. Upload photos in app ✅
3. Email opens ✅
4. Photos aren't attached? 😕
5. Have to manually attach anyway ❓

## 📊 Flow Comparison

### Old Flow (Confusing)
```
Report tent → Upload photos (5 steps) → 
Preview → Email opens → 
"Wait, where are my photos?" → 
Manual attachment anyway
```

### New Flow (Clear)
```
Report tent → 
"Take photos and attach to email" → 
Email opens → 
Attach photos → 
Send
```

## ✨ Benefits

1. **Faster**: Skip the upload/preview steps
2. **Clearer**: Explicit about what user needs to do
3. **Simpler**: Less code = fewer bugs
4. **Honest**: No false promise of auto-attachment
5. **Mobile-friendly**: Users take photos with camera app (better quality)

## 🎉 Result

A streamlined app that:
- Collects all Portland's required information
- Reminds users about photos at the right time
- Generates a professional email report
- Sets clear expectations about photo attachment
- Takes 2-3 minutes total

**No photo upload complexity = More reliable tool!**
