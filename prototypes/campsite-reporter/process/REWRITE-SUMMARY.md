# Major Rewrite - Simplified Question Flow

## What Changed

### Site Items: Multi-Select â†’ Three Yes/No Questions

**Before:**
- One multi-select question: "Which items are visible? (select all)"
- Options: Tent, Vehicle, Trash
- User taps checkboxes, then "Continue"

**After:**
- Question 3: "Is there a tent, tarp, or other shelter?" Yes/No
- Question 4: "Trash or debris?" Yes/No  
- Question 5: "Is there a vehicle?" Yes/No
- Each is a simple yes/no button tap

### Vehicle Questions: Buttons â†’ Text Input

**Before:**
- 5 questions with button options
- Vehicle type: 9 button options
- Make: 7 button options
- Color: 9 button options
- Plate state: 5 button options
- Plate number: text input

**After:**
- 4 questions, all text input
- What kind of vehicle? (text)
- What make/model? (text)
- What color? (text)
- What is the license plate state and number? (text - combined!)

### Photo Reminders: Same

**Both versions:**
- Show photo reminder after tent = Yes
- Show photo reminder after trash = Yes
- Show photo reminder after vehicle questions

## Benefits of New Approach

### 1. Simpler Code
- Removed multi-select button logic (~50 lines)
- Removed vehicle button arrays (~100 lines)
- Cleaner conditional flow

### 2. Faster for Users
- Yes/No questions are faster than checkboxes
- No "Continue" button needed
- Text input is faster than scrolling through options

### 3. More Flexible
- Users can type any vehicle make/model (not limited to list)
- Combined plate state + number = one input instead of two
- Natural language input ("blue Ford pickup")

### 4. Mobile Friendly
- Fewer buttons = less scrolling
- Keyboard pops up for vehicle questions (expected on mobile)
- Simple tap â†’ type â†’ tap flow

## Question Count Comparison

### Minimum Path (Nothing Present)
- Before: 6 core + 2 optional = 8
- After: 7 core + 2 optional = 9
- **Difference: +1 question** (but still very fast)

### With Vehicle
- Before: 6 core + 5 vehicle + 2 optional = 13
- After: 7 core + 4 vehicle + 2 optional = 13
- **Difference: Same total** (but faster input method)

### Maximum Path (Everything)
- Before: 6 core + 5 vehicle + 2 optional + 3 photo reminders = 16
- After: 7 core + 4 vehicle + 2 optional + 3 photo reminders = 16
- **Difference: Same total**

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Questions Array
- Replaced multi-select question with three yes/no questions
- Updated keys: `siteItems` â†’ `hasTent`, `hasTrash`, `hasVehicle`

### 2. addButtons Function
- Removed multi-select mode completely
- Simplified to only single-select buttons

### 3. handleUserResponse Function

### 4. Vehicle Questions
- Reduced from 5 to 4 questions
- Removed all button options arrays
- All questions now text-input only
- Combined plate state + number into single question

### 5. Summary Display
- Changed to show tent/trash/vehicle from yes/no answers
- Updated vehicle details to show combined plate info

### 6. Email Body
- Updated to list site items from yes/no flags
- Changed plate display to single combined field

## Testing Checklist

Test these scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Only Tent
- [ ] Location â†’ Blocking â†’ Tent=Yes â†’ Photo reminder
- [ ] Trash=No â†’ Vehicle=No
