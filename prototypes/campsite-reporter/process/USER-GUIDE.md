## What Happens After You Submit?

According to Portland's Impact Reduction Program:

1. **Automatic work order created** - Your report dispatches a crew
2. **Assessment team visits** - Central City Concern's Clean Start (staff with lived experience)
3. **Trash pickup** - Crew removes garbage and biohazards
4. **Resource offers** - Outreach provides housing/service info to campers
5. **Risk assessment** - Site evaluated for health/safety concerns
6. **Removal if needed** - Highest-risk sites scheduled for removal (48-hour notice)

**Your report matters** - each one helps the city prioritize and respond!
